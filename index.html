<!--
1. Describe how your dashboard answers the questions presented.
You don't have to address every question directly, but should at a
high level address the main questions. (10 points)

Graph 1 shows the top 10 best selling games of all time as a bar graph
with clearly labelled values. Graph 2 is a donut chart that toggles between
regions with buttons, which shows the fraction of game sales accounting for
each of the 12 genres present in the data set; one can find the best-selling
genre per region by finding the largest donut segment. Graph 3 toggle between
genres with the dropdown menu and shows the top 5 publishers for both the total
sales within a genre and the average return per game. This graph tells us
who sells the most games in a genre and who makes consistantly high-selling
games within that genre. Interactivity is in graphs 2 and 3 and
tooltips are on graph 2.

2. List 3 reasons why D3 was helpful and improved your visualization. (6 points)

D3 made binding data to svg objects extremely easy. Because it has structures for
making all sorts of graphs it was easy to find one I wanted and plug in my data. The
built-in analysis functions also were helpful.

3. List 3 reasons why D3 would not be the best tool for creating a visualization (6 points)

There's a huge learning curve to getting into d3. It sometimes feels very obtuse with its
syntax and methods, and I struggled to understand what examples were doing when I researched
them. Overall it feels much more clunky and complicated than something like matplotlib.

4. Evaluate the accessibility of your dashboard based on the readings in the
“Before you begin” section. What kinds of users might find this dashboard
accessible and who might have more difficulty? What additional actions might
you take to make this dashboard more accessible to all audiences?
Your response should refer to at least one of the readings and be about 1
paragraph.

In "A Comprehensive Guide to Accessible Data Visualization," several guidelines
are introduced to help data scientists create accessible visualizations. I did
my best to implement these, but struggled because of my limited understanding of d3
and by the data set itself. For one thing, I tried not to rely on color to convey
information. There are no color based legends; everything is labelled directly. I
wanted to use more contrasting colors with my donut graph, but it became challenging
to find a set of 12 colors that all contrasted well. Additionally, the guide reccommends
against using tooltips, but I had to include those because of the assignment.

Overall, I don't think my dashboard is very accessible. The visually impared would
have an especially hard time because I don't have alt text on my html elements.


5. Reflect on the stages of your design and implementation process when you
could have taken steps to make your dashboard more accessible to all audiences.
What are some factors that kept you from taking these steps? (a few sentences)

Both time and experience with d3 limited what accesibility features I could
implement. The limited time pushed implementing accesibility features down in
priority, because I was so focused on meeting the assignment guidelines. These
features should have been planned from the earliest stages of sketching out graphs.
